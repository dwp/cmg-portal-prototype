    <p>Let us know if the gross taxable annual income, we have previously used to calculate your child maintenance, has already increased or decreased.</p>

    <p>You can only report a change of income that has already happened. If income is changing in the future, complete this report after the effective date.</p>

    <p>We review Child Maintenance each year, on the anniversary of the date we were first told about the application for child maintenance.</p>

    <p>"If the income has changed by less than 25%, we will take this into consideration at the time of your Annual Review."</p>

    <p>Changes in circumstances may affect your child maintenance.</p>
